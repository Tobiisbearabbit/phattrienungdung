<p>Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you need a button, use the button element and not a div element:</p>

<button>Report an Error</button>

<div>Report an Error</div>

<p>A button element has more suitable styling than a div, and it is clickable by default.</p>
